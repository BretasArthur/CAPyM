# CAPyM

These are some codes related to CAPM and portfolio management with Python. In the next lines I expect to explain the basics about CAPM, Beta, and some of the tools used to calculate it in Python, but I strongly recommend a review of the references at the end of this doc.

## Capital Asset Pricing Model

According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_asset_pricing_model), CAPM is a model used to determine the appropriate rate of return of an asset, and it can be helpful when building a diversified portfolio. It can be expressed by:

Where the Beta represents the sensitivity of an asset in comparison with a benchmark:
